1. Univariate Linear Regression
2. Multiple Linear Regression
3. Polynomial Regression
4. Support Vector Regression (SVR)
5. Lasso Regression
6. Logistic Regression
7. Support Vector Machine
8. Decision Tree
9. Random Forest
10. Naive Bayes
11. K-Nearest Neighbors
12. Gradient Boosting Machines (GBM)
13. Adaptive Boosting (AdaBoost)
